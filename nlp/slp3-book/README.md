# Book Updater

This is a Python script that automatically downloads the fully updated version of the freely available book "Speech and Language Processing" by Professor Jurafsky and Martin. The script is designed to make it easy for you to keep up with the latest version of the book without having to manually download and update it yourself.

## Features

- Automatically downloads the fully updated version of the book
- Easy to use and customizable
- Future features to be added via checklist:
  - [ ] Developing a mechanism for comparing the-already-downloaded and to-be-downloaded PDFs
  - [ ] Renaming PDFs properly so they can be addressed well
  - [ ] Using AI and properly named chapters to merge PDFs while creating sections and subsections
  - [ ] Stop making hard-coded scripts and use some automatic approach

## Future Features
